"""
Transit Signal Priority (TSP) System - Dynamic Implementation
=============================================================
A MUTCD/FHWA-compliant TSP implementation for a 4-way signalized 
intersection with dynamic bus priority based on real-time detection.

Key Features:
- Exact 100-second cycles (200s total for 2 cycles)
- MUTCD-compliant yellow (3.7s) and all-red (1.4s) intervals
- Dynamic TSP that responds to bus arrival times
- Green extension and early termination logic
- Schedule adherence checks (only helps late buses)
- Minimum time between TSP activations
